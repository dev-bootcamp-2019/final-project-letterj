Deploy your application onto one of the test networks. Include a document called deployed_addresses.txt
that describes where your contracts live (which testnet and address).

Students can verify their source code using etherscan for the appropriate 
testnet https://etherscan.io/verifyContract 

Evaluators can check by getting the provided contract ABI and calling a 
function on the deployed contract at https://www.myetherwallet.com/#contracts 
or checking the verification on etherscan
